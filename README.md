# pyWelcomeBot
Simple Discord bot written in Python to welcome new members to a Discord server and alert admins when members leave the server.

# Introduction
The bot was originally intended to welcome new members to a Discord server upon joining and alert server admins when members departed the server. The original functionality within the bot remains, however, it has evolved into a hodge podge of tools (mostly administrative) that will be explained in further detail.

The bot functionality is split into three groups: monitoring functions, background tasks, and commands. The first group represents functions that are invisible to the user and execute any time a message is posted to the server (excluding private messages). The second represents background tasks that execute based on a prescribed schedule. The last represents commands that can be invoked as needed from within Discord.

# Monitoring Functions
### New and Departed Members
The bot welcomes users to the Discord server and alerts admins of any members who have departed. The contents of the message for new and departed members, along with specific channels to which the message is sent, is stored within the bot configuration file.

### Collection of Message Metadata
Under development: The bot collects metadata for all messages posted to the server excluding private messages, messages within certain channels, and messages from certain users. The message metadata is sent directly to an Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) message queue. The message queue triggers a serverless AWS Lambda function which parses the metadata and stores the data in a PostgreSQL database for analytics.

# Background Task(s)
### Online Clan Members
Added a background task to the bot that builds a list of clan members in-game every two minutes. The list is written to a Redis cache in order to support faster retrieval from the bot.

An example of the formatted list stored in the cache:

```
{
  "Iron Orange Earth": "mr_rots: Social - Tower (0.00m)\nRetired_Lenni: Explore - Hellas Basin (15.17m)",
  "Iron Orange Mars": "SheNanigans_85_: Explore - Titan (19.14m)"
}
```

Added an **on_message** event to listen for the command *!online*. The command calls an API endpoint that retrieves a list of clan members in-game and sends a direct message to the user who invoked the command.

### Daily Pull of Discord Accounts
The background task executes at a prescribed time once a day to pull a list of accounts on the Discord server. The accounts are passed through an API endpoint to a serverless AWS Lambda function which parses and stores the accounts within an Amazon RDS PostgreSQL database instance. The stored accounts are processed within the database to try and create a cross reference of Destiny 2 accounts and Discord accounts.

# Supported Commands
## !online
The *!online* command retrieves the most recent list of clan members currently playing Destiny 2, formats the list, and sends a direct message to the user who executed the command.

The command relies upon two background tasks within the bot. The [first](https://github.com/dad2cl3/pyWelcomeBot/blob/master/aws/lambda/get_online_report.py) calls an API endpoint which refreshes the list of clan members online and stores the list in a Redis cache. The refresh task runs on a interval that is specified within the bot configuration file. The [second](https://github.com/dad2cl3/pyWelcomeBot/blob/master/aws/lambda/refresh_online_report.py) simply retrieves the list from the Redis cache, formats it, and sends it to the requestor as a direct message.

The command response appears as follows within Discord:

## !link report
The *!link report* command retrieves a list of Discord and Destiny 2 accounts which can not be found within a maintained account cross reference table.

The command relies upon a cross reference table that contains the relationship between Discord user accounts and Destiny gaming accounts. Two views built on the cross reference table provide the data for the report. The [first](https://github.com/dad2cl3/destiny-clan-member-manager/blob/master/sql/discord/create_view-vw_discord_accounts.sql) identifies Discord accounts which have no corresponding entry in the account cross reference. The [second](https://github.com/dad2cl3/destiny-clan-member-manager/blob/master/sql/discord/create_view-vw_destiny_accounts.sql) identifies Destiny accounts which do not have a corresponding entry in the account cross reference. The two lists are formatted as inline fields within a Discord Embed and returned to the requestor as a direct message.

The command response appears as follows within Discord:

## !link gamertag:gamertag discord:discord - TODO: Add details
The *!link gamertag:gamertag discord:discord* command allows a user (or admin) manually link Discord and Destiny 2 accounts that can not be linked automatically.
